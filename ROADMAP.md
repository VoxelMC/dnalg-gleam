# DNAlg Roadmap

This file can be used to track my progress.
When I complete something, I will timestamp it so you can see if I am still working hard on this project.

-   [ ] Create the api for restriction site analysis
    -   [ ] Be able to take in custom restriction sites with a specific parseable format
    -   [ ] Be able to take in a DNA sequence and return the number of restriction sites
    -   [ ] Have a standard library of common restriction enzymes for synthetic biology standards (MoClo, BioBrick, etc.)
-   [x] Create the sequence silent mutator to get rid of enzyme cut sites.
    -   [ ] Make it get rid of every site, not just the first
